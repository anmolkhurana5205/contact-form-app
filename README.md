- Note : All the contact us form data will be stored in the cloud database (mongodb atlas)
- This is my first mini project in which i am using the storage other than local storage.
- So yes great learning and backend was managed by node runtime hosted on render.com
- At render.com I opted free plan of deployment so whoever try to access the contact us form after a while (after an inactivity of few hours) they have to face a delay of 50sec to 1 min. (sorry for the inconvenience)
